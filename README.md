 ## Array Method
## Task - 1
### 1. Get all the countries from Asia continent /region using Filter method

 - Get all the countries from Asia continent /region using Filter method
 - Data Setup: The initial JSON contains an array of country objects, each with a name and region property.
 - Filter Method: Use the JavaScript filter method to iterate over the array of countries and select those where the region property is "Asia".
 - Result Formation: Store the filtered array in a new JSON object under the key asianCountries.
 - Output: The final JSON object contains only the countries from the Asia region.
 
 > Note : The above question solution is in the Asia continent.js.

## Task - 2
### 2. Get all the countries with a population of less than 2 lakhs using Filter method

 - An array of country objects with their populations is created.
 - The filter method is used to create a new array filteredCountries that includes only those countries with a population of less than 200,000.
 - JSON.stringify is used to convert the filtered array into a JSON string, which is then logged to the console. The null and 2 arguments in JSON.stringify are used to format the output with a 2-space indentation for readability.

 > Note : The above question solution is in the countries population.js.

## Task - 3
### 3. Print the following details name, capital, flag, using forEach method

 - To solve this problem using JavaScript, we can utilize the forEach method to iterate over an array of country objects and print the required details: name, capital, and flag. Here is a JSON representation of the countries and a JavaScript code
 - JSON Data: The array of objects represents countries, each with a name, capital, and flag.
 - JavaScript Code: The forEach method iterates over the countries array. For each country object, the details are printed using console.log.

 > Note : The about qustion solution is in the name, capital, flag.js.

## Task - 4
### 4. Print the total population of countries using reduce method

 - To solve this problem using the reduce method in JavaScript, we will assume you have an array of country objects where each object contains a population property.
 - The reduce method takes two arguments: the accumulator (which holds the total population) and the current country object being processed.
 - It adds the population of the current country to the accumulator and returns the new total population.

 > Note : The above question solution is in the total population countries.js.

## Task - 5
### 5. Print the country that uses US dollars as currency.

 - To solve the problem of finding the country that uses US dollars as currency using array functions in JSON format
 - Create a JSON array of countries with their respective currencies.
 - Use a filter function to find the country that uses US dollars as currency.
 - This JSON format provides a structured way to solve the problem and the code snippet demonstrates how to use array functions to filter the desired country based on its currency.

> Note : The about qustion solution is in the country that uses US dollars.js
